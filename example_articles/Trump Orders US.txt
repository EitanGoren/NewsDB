The United States will exit the World Health Organization,
President Donald Trump said on Monday.
Saying the global health agency had mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic and other international health crises.
Trump said the WHO had failed to act independently from the "inappropriate political influence of WHO member states"
and required "unfairly onerous payments" from the U.S.
that are disproportionate to the sums provided by other, larger countries, such as China.
