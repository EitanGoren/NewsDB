The IDF Arabic language spokesperson Avichay Adraee on Tuesday issued a stern warning to Gazans
not to approach troops still deployed in the Strip or the border with Israel.
In his announcement Adraee said that if Hamas lived up to the commitments in the cease-fire deal,
they would be able to return to areas in northern Gaza next week.
